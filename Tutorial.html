    <h1>Volley</h1>
    In Blue Lock Rivals, performing a volley is a special technique that allows your character to score goals directly off
an assist without letting the ball touch the ground. To successfully execute a volley, you first need to have a striker
who has a volley skill or synergy that supports volley-type plays. During the match simulation, you'll need to build
team synergy and pass combinations that set up a volley opportunity. Typically, this means having a midfielder or winger
with an assist skill that triggers a volley chance. Once the conditions are right, and if the striker's volley skill
activates, you'll see a cinematic or highlighted animation showing the character executing the move. Timing, team
composition, and skill synergy are key factors in triggering and succeeding with volleys. Make sure to level up the
striker and support players to increase the odds of the skill activating during the game.



<h1>Volley(generic)</h1>
In Blue Lock Rivals, performing a volley without relying on a character’s special ability is all about team setup and
match simulation conditions. To trigger a volley naturally, you need to create a play where the striker receives a pass
in midair—such as a cross or a chip pass—without the ball touching the ground. This can happen during normal gameplay if
you use midfielders or wingers with high passing stats to deliver the ball into the box, and a striker with solid
shooting and positioning stats waiting in front of goal. The key is to ensure the assist is fast or lofted, so the
striker reacts with a first-time shot before the ball lands. Even without an equipped volley skill, the game will
sometimes animate a basic volley shot based on stats, positioning, and timing. By building plays that emphasize aerial
assists or quick passing combinations, you can naturally trigger a volley and increase your chances of scoring stylish
goals.



<h1>Header</h1>
In Blue Lock: Rivals, doing a header is simple and manual—you don’t need to set up formations or rely on abilities. When
you're in a match and your character receives a cross or lofted ball, just tap the shoot button while jumping to perform
a header. The jump and shoot action together trigger the header animation if your character is in the right position
near the ball. You don’t need any special timing system or stat setup—just make sure you jump into the ball and shoot as
it comes toward you. That’s it. It’s all about good positioning and pressing jump + shoot at the right moment.


<h1>Goalkeeping</h1>
In Blue Lock: Rivals, when you're controlling the goalkeeper during a match, your job is to react quickly and block
incoming shots using timing and positioning. When the opponent shoots, you’ll see a red circle or aiming indicator
showing where the ball is going. To save the shot, you need to drag your finger or swipe toward that direction and tap
at the right time to dive and make the save. The timing is critical — too early or too late and you’ll miss. If the shot
is close to the center, just tapping quickly might be enough, but for corner shots, you’ll need to swipe further to
reach it. The closer the ball is to the edge of the goal, the faster your reaction needs to be. There’s no special stat
to rely on — it’s all about reflexes and practice. Also, some shots come with a charge or animation — in these cases,
pay attention to the wind-up and be ready to commit to a direction just before the shot is released. Mastering
goalkeeping in BLR means staying calm, reading the shooter, and practicing your reaction timing to consistently block
even fast, tricky shots.
