    <h1>Volley</h1>
    In Blue Lock Rivals, performing a volley is a special technique that allows your character to score goals directly off
an assist without letting the ball touch the ground. To successfully execute a volley, you first need to have a striker
who has a volley skill or synergy that supports volley-type plays. During the match simulation, you'll need to build
team synergy and pass combinations that set up a volley opportunity. Typically, this means having a midfielder or winger
with an assist skill that triggers a volley chance. Once the conditions are right, and if the striker's volley skill
activates, you'll see a cinematic or highlighted animation showing the character executing the move. Timing, team
composition, and skill synergy are key factors in triggering and succeeding with volleys. Make sure to level up the
striker and support players to increase the odds of the skill activating during the game.
